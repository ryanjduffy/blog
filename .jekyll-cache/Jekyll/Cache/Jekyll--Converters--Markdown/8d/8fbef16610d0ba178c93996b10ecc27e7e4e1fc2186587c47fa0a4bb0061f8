I"Ö<p><strong>Score Keeper</strong></p>
<p>Had to take some time away from my Enyo Daily series to actually finish up my first Touchpad app!!Â  It's called Score Keeper and, as the name implies, it helps you keep track of the score for a game or activity.Â  I just submitted it to the catalog and should be available soon.Â  You'll find it <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=com.tiqtech.scorekeeper">here </a>once it's available.</p>
