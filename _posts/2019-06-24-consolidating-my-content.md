I decided this past week or so to try to resurrect my writing by fleshing out a [post of weekly releases]({% post_url 2019-06-16-weekly-releases %}). That gave me just enoough momentum to also migrate content from my long forgotten [Tumblr](https://ryanjduffy.tumblr.com), [Medium](https://medium.com/@theryanjduffy), and [Code Mentor](https://www.codementor.io/ryan286/posts) accounts.

While each service has their place and provide a community of content, I wanted to own my own content and be in more control of its availability. I might still cross-post to those places but intend to use this site sourced from [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanjduffy/blog) as the home for new content.
