I"À<p>Enyo has a pretty deep inheritance heirarcy and one of our areas of research right now is ways to
flatten it to improve performance and ease debugging. Weâ€™ve discussed increasing our use of mixins
(or something similar, perhaps) to add functionality to a kind without defining an entirely new one.
Mixins have a couple of drawbacks regarding overriding methods, however:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You have to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kind.inherit</code> which is a bit awkward</li>
  <li>It still increases the call stack</li>
</ol>

<p>One common place for method overrides are the lifecycle methods (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">destroy()</code>). In
most cases, the mixin does its work either before or after the call to the super without modifying
the arguments. To make this a bit easier, Iâ€™m proposing a new HookSupport mixin.</p>
