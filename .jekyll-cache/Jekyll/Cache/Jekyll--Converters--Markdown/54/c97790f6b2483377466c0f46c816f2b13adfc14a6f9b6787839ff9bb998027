I"Ë<p><p>CSS transitions are a really easy way to add basic animation to an enyo app. Â It works on (seemingly) any CSS property and takes JavaScript out of the picture. Â  With Pirate's Dice (which is still not fully functional ...), I'm using them to zoom the background when starting a new game. Â I'm also trying to support multiple resolutions (phones in portrait and landscape, tablets, and desktop) using media queries.[[MORE]]</p>

<p>To accomplish this, I'm scaling the background image differently for smaller screens than larger.</p>

<pre><code>

.animate {
    -webkit-transition:all 500ms ease-out;
}

/* portrait */

.app {
    background:#3e140c url(../image/bg.png) no-repeat 50% 100%;
    -webkit-background-size:auto 100%;
}

.app.new-game {
    -webkit-background-size:auto 200%;
}

/* landscape */
.app {
    -webkit-background-size:100% auto;
}

.app.new-game {
    -webkit-background-size:200% auto;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The consequence of this was that changing orientations of the phone would cause WebKit to animate the width from 100% to auto along with the height from auto to 100%. Â This turns out to be a rather jarring experience. Â To avoid this, I added a sprinkle of script to the resize handler that removes the animate class when resize starts and readds it once its complete. Â enyo.job does the work of ensuring reanimate only runs once. Â In other words, it won't be constantly added and readded as the window is resized such as on a desktop browser.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
resizeHandler:function() {
    this.removeClass(â€œanimateâ€);
    enyo.job(â€œfrankensteinâ€, enyo.bind(this, â€œreanimateâ€), 200);
},
reanimate:function() {
    this.addClass(â€œanimateâ€);
}
</code></pre></p>
