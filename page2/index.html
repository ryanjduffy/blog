doing the same. This installment is the rather simple <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a> include to embed

the latter defaulting to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codepen_username</code> value in the site’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>.</p>

        <p>
        <p>Enyo has a pretty deep inheritance heirarcy and one of our areas of research right now is ways to
flatten it to improve performance and ease debugging. We’ve discussed increasing our use of mixins
(or something similar, perhaps) to add functionality to a kind without defining an entirely new one.
Mixins have a couple of drawbacks regarding overriding methods, however:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You have to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kind.inherit</code> which is a bit awkward</li>
  <li>It still increases the call stack</li>
</ol>

<p>One common place for method overrides are the lifecycle methods (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">destroy()</code>). In
most cases, the mixin does its work either before or after the call to the super without modifying
the arguments. To make this a bit easier, I’m proposing a new HookSupport mixin.</p>

        <p>
        <p><p>I've been playing around with the Cloud9 IDE a bit recently to do some remote development. It's come a long way from when I first used it and is quite functional. A great addition is an interactive command line with a git client. So I thought, "It'd be nice to get the EnyoJS bootplate up and running here."  Following the <a href="https://github.com/enyojs/enyo/wiki/Dupliforking">general instructions from the wiki</a>, I put together a set of commands that gets everything set up.</p>
<p><b>TL; DR</b></p>
<p>Pull in bootplate, update the submodules, and "disconnect" the master branch from the bootplate repo.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>
        <p>Gravatar is an service that allows users to specify a public avatar image linked to an email address. I recently decided to allow users to use their Gravatar avatar with my Parse-backed app rather than build in my own avatar system. To simplify things, I’ve hooked beforeSave for the User object to hash the email address and add it to the object. That ensures that any email address change is automatically hashed on the server and allows me to send the hash down to clients rather than the email address to protect privacy.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>function MD5(s){ /* one of many publicly available MD5 functions */ }

Parse.Cloud.beforeSave(Parse.User, function(request, response) {
    var email = request.object.get("email");
    request.object.set("emailHash", email? MD5(email) : "");
    response.success();
});
</code></pre></div></div>

        <p>
        <p>Obviously you can add appCache to existing apps but there are a couple things I think the framework could add here. First, let’s get the appcache events wired into enyo’s event model.</p>

        <p>
        <p>Wanted to share a preview of a new kind I’ve been working on. The idea stemmed from a recent patch I submitted to fix remote loading of js into enyo. A prime use case for that capbility is to deliver a mobile website in which the entire site could be integrated into a single enyo app without loading the entire source on load. Each view could be managed by a parent enyo.Panels and loaded as requested.</p>

        <p><b>Update:</b> Latest code available on <a href="https://github.com/tiqtech/enyo-extras/tree/master/source/util">github</a></p>

<p>The view state framework is a relatively simple but extensible mechanism to manage the state of view controls. The definition of view control is loose but is intended to represent any control on which a user might expect to be able to "go back" to a previous state. The framework is not a view controller in MVC fashion but can be adapted to that purpose. I've done just that by extending the enyo.Panels control.
