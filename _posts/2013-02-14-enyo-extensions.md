<p>I have a couple extensions to Enyo that are in varying degrees of maturity that could use some external feedback and development. Below is a summary of each. If you're using these, something similar, or have some thoughts on where they should go, I'd like to work with you to improve them. Feel free to comment below, catch me on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/theryanjduffy">@theryanjduffy</a> or send an email to ryan@tiqtech.com.

<b>View State Framework</b>
The view state framework is a relatively simple but extensible mechanism to manage the state of view controls. The definition of view control is loose but is intended to represent any control on which a user might expect to be able to “go back” to a previous state.

<b>RemoteControl</b>
Retrieves a remote JS file and attempts to instantiate the specified kind as a child component. Provides a pluggable loading spinner. Seems like a building block for a single-page app (sub)framework but that needs some more thought.

<b>Platform-Aware Controls</b>
Pattern/framework to enable native-feeling apps across different platforms by providing generalized components for common interactions.
