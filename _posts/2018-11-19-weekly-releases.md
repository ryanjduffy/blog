# Thesis

Adopting weekly releases has been a big win for our team

# Problems

* Single customer was driving our release schedule and, by extension, the content of that release
* Additional mental load on the team to remember when releases were scheduled
* Delayed getting shippable code into the hands of our customers
* Promoted FOMO - push risky changes in at the last minute in fear of missing the opportunity to include it or long delays before it was included

# Result

* Features and fixes land sooner for customer
* Release management became more predictable for everyone involved. It's allowed us to define repeatable processes around when we accept work for a release, when integration testing occurs, and when releases are tagged and shared with our customers.
* It has curtailed FOMO because we have a known next release in which changes can land if they aren't ready.
* It has helped us balance requirements for new products and customers which can adopt the more frequent releases based on their own timelines.
* It has placed us in more control of what and when is included in a release
