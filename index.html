        <p>After getting a <a href="/blog/2019/07/04/rust-wasm-getting-started.html">basic game of life running in Rust + WASM</a>, I wanted to expand it a bit further to
allow seeding the initial state. Initially, I planned to allow an array of flags
to seed any value but decided instead to use strings instead. It proved to be a
bit more difficult but also more interesting.</p>

        <p>
        <p>I get to spend a lot of time reviewing other engineers’ code. Over time, I’ve
found that it has helped me become a better engineer as I learned new techniques
to solve problems, explored parts of the code base that I haven’t worked in
before, and improved my ability to communicate effectively to others.</p>

<p>Through the course of my reviews, I’ve seen some common practices that I feel
make for good pull requests. Some may be obvious but others are a bit more
subtle.</p>

        <p>I decided this past week or so to try to resurrect my writing by fleshing out a <a href="/blog/2019/06/16/weekly-releases.html">post of weekly releases</a>. That gave me just enoough momentum to also migrate content from my long forgotten <a href="https://ryanjduffy.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@theryanjduffy">Medium</a>, and <a href="https://www.codementor.io/ryan286/posts">Code Mentor</a> accounts.</p>

<p>While each service has their place and provide a community of content, I wanted to own my own content and be in more control of its availability. I might still cross-post to those places but intend to use this site sourced from <a href="https://github.com/ryanjduffy/blog">GitHub</a> as the home for new content.</p>

<p>Like many engineers, I spend a lot of time working with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code>. It’s an incredibly powerful tool with more options than most people ever need. If you work in the CLI like I do, you’ve probably added a few aliases to help make you more productive. Today, I added a new one to list merge conflicts.</p>

<p>One of the most important concepts of React is unidirectional data flow. Data enters the system at one point and flows downstream with each component filtering and augmenting that data for its children. This is an incredibly simple but also very powerful paradigm that enables you to build complex systems with simple data flows.</p>

<p>I recently had a discussion with a coworker about the naming of a function property that will be passed to a React component. It got me thinking more thoroughly about the role of functions as properties. I find that they usually fall into one of two camps. The function either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notifies the container of user or component action, or</li>
  <li>Provides some capability that the component needs.</li>
</ul>
