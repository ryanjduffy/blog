I"ó<p>I decided this past week or so to try to resurrect my writing by fleshing out a <a href="/blog/2019/06/16/weekly-releases.html">post of weekly releases</a>. That gave me just enoough momentum to also migrate content from my long forgotten <a href="https://ryanjduffy.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@theryanjduffy">Medium</a>, and <a href="https://www.codementor.io/ryan286/posts">Code Mentor</a> accounts.</p>

<p>While each service has their place and provide a community of content, I wanted to own my own content and be in more control of its availability. I might still cross-post to those places but intend to use this site sourced from <a href="https://github.com/ryanjduffy/blog">GitHub</a> as the home for new content.</p>
