<p>Working on a new game for webOS (and possibly other platforms) called Pirate's Dice.  I'm hoping to support both the classic rules of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_dice">Liar's Dice</a> as well a variation or two.  I have a playable alpha build working and am working on polish.  I'll be looking for beta testers soon I hope so let me know in comments or via email [admin-at-tiqtech.com] if you're interested.</p>
