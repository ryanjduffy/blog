I"¿<p>I have a couple extensions to Enyo that are in varying degrees of maturity that could use some external feedback and development. Below is a summary of each. If you're using these, something similar, or have some thoughts on where they should go, I'd like to work with you to improve them. Feel free to comment below, catch me on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/theryanjduffy">@theryanjduffy</a> or send an email to ryan@tiqtech.com.
