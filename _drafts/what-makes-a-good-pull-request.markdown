title: What Makes a Good Pull Request?

I get to spend a lot of time reviewing other engineers' code. Over time, I've found that it has
helped me become a better engineer as I learn new techniques to solve problems, explore parts of the
code base that I haven't worked in before, and improved my ability to communicate effectively to
others.

Through the course of my reviews, I've seen some common practices that make for good pull requests.
A good pull request is one that clearly describes what was changed and why it was changed, adds
tests that validate the change, adheres to the conventions of the project, limits the change to a
single problem...
