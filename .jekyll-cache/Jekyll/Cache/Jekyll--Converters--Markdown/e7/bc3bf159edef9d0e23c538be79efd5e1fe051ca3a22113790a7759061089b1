<p>Like many engineers, I spend a lot of time working with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code>. Itâ€™s an incredibly powerful tool with more options than most people ever need. If you work in the CLI like I do, youâ€™ve probably added a few aliases to help make you more productive. Today, I added a new one to list merge conflicts.</p>
