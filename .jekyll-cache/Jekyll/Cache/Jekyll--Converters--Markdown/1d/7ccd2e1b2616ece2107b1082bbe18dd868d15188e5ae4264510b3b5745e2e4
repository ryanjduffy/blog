<p>I recently had a discussion with a coworker about the naming of a function property that will be passed to a React component. It got me thinking more thoroughly about the role of functions as properties. I find that they usually fall into one of two camps. The function either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notifies the container of user or component action, or</li>
  <li>Provides some capability that the component needs.</li>
</ul>
