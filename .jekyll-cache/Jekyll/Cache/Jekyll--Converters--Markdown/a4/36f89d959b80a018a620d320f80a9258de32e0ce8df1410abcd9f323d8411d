I"ê<p>I get to spend a lot of time reviewing other engineersâ€™ code. Over time, Iâ€™ve
found that it has helped me become a better engineer as I learned new techniques
to solve problems, explored parts of the code base that I havenâ€™t worked in
before, and improved my ability to communicate effectively to others.</p>

<p>Through the course of my reviews, Iâ€™ve seen some common practices that I feel
make for good pull requests. Some may be obvious but others are a bit more
subtle.</p>
