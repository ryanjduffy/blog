<p>The view state framework is a relatively simple but extensible mechanism to manage the state of view controls. The definition of view control is loose but is intended to represent any control on which a user might expect to be able to "go back" to a previous state. The framework is not a view controller in MVC fashion but can be adapted to that purpose. I've done just that by extending the enyo.Panels control.
